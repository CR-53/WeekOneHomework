01 HTML CSS Git: Code Refactor

**Version 1.0.0**

## Task Description
The task was to refactor the supplied code to meet basic web accessability standards. These standards are used by Web Developers to ensure people with disabilities or Socio-economic restrictions have access to websites. I have followed <a href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/standards-guidelines/wcag/">Web Content Accessability Guidlines (WCAG)</a> found on the  Web Accessability Initiative (WAI) website, when refactoring the code.

## Prefix
When refactoring this website, I was working with a large monitor size and basing the styling for the website using my personal browser size. I have since learnt that this is not suitable practice for Web Development, however for this particular week one homework assignment I have not made any further updates to my styling to meet a standard sized screen. This means that if you are viewing my work on a smaller monitor (or browser window) than what I have used, the website will not be formatted properly.

I have used a browser size of 1920px X 969px to re-design this website. 

I have included a screenshot below of how the website looks in my browser. I understand that this homework assignment is more focused on the HTML/CSS code rather than browser responsiveness, however when referring to my work later in this ReadMe I will be basing it off the screenshot below.
