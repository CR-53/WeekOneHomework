01 HTML CSS Git: Code Refactor

**Version 1.0.0**

## Task Description
The task was to refactor the supplied code to meet basic web accessability standards. These standards are used by Web Developers to ensure people with disabilities or Socio-economic restrictions have access to websites. I have followed <a href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/standards-guidelines/wcag/">Web Content Accessability Guidlines (WCAG)</a> found on the  Web Accessability Initiative (WAI) website, when refactoring the code.

## Prefix
When refactoring this website, I was working with a large monitor size and basing the styling for the website using my personal browser size. I have since learnt that this is not suitable practice for Web Development, however for this particular week one homework assignment I have not made any further updates to my styling to meet a standard sized screen. This means that if you are viewing my work on a smaller monitor (or browser window) than what I have used, the website will not be formatted properly.

I have used a browser size of 1920px X 969px to re-design this website. 

I have included an image below of how the website looks in my browser. I understand that this homework assignment is more focused on the HTML/CSS code rather than browser responsiveness, however when referring to my work later in this ReadMe I will be basing it off the image below.

## Following Web Content Accessability Guidelines (WCAG)

In this section of the ReadMe I will outline the major changes I made to the website and the WCAG theory that provoked these changes to be made.

### Adding "alt" tags

Alt tags are used to convery the purpose of an image for users who do not see the image. Users not being able to see the image on their screen can be down to a number of factors, however the most common of these are due to the person being visually impaired or having turned images off to increase download speed or save bandwidth.

When a person cannot see the image, the alt text can be played using a screen reader. The hero image was purely decorative so no alt tag was needed. The other images supported what the text was saying, so I decided to an alt tag for these.
